Hi! My name is Kenny. I'm a librarian working in digital publishing and digital libraries. I currently work at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries as the Digital Scholarly Publishing Librarian. Prior to Penn, I worked at the Digital Public Library of America, a non-profit digital library that aggregates metadata and thumbnails for millions of cultural heritage materials from libraries, museums and archives across the US. I previously worked at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. My interests include reading, soccer, video games, GLAMs, and spending time with my wife and family. I'm an alum of Vassar College and Simmons University.
